    Optimized version of the function read_single_address. This function is significantly faster after 100 addresses

        nested_list (list): List of *args of the function read_single_address. You don't have to pass all of the
        parameters for each list in the nested_list, only parameters address and value_index are obligatory. Defaults

        Parameters are partially passed--‚ñº
